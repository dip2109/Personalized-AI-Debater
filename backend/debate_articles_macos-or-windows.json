        "Content": "How to Change Simulation Distance in Minecraft?If youâve ever wondered why your farms suddenly stop working when you walk awayâor why mobs disappear just a few blocks outâit all comes down to one setting: simulation distance. This often-overlooked option can make or break your in-game experience, affecting everything from redstone machines to mob farms and even overall performance. Whether youâre optimizing your world or just trying to reduce lag, hereâs how to quickly and effectively tweak simulation distance in both Minecraft Bedrock and Java editions.How to Change View Distance/Simulation Distance in Minecraft?Simulation distance decides how far away stuff still âworks.â Redstone contraptions, mob spawns, plant growth, water flowsâall of these depend on simulation distance. If somethingâs outside that range? It wonât tick. That means your crops wonât grow and your mobs wonât move unless you're close enough.So if your massive auto-farm isn't working unless you're standing next to it, this is probably why.What is Simulation Distance and How Do You Change It?Why It MattersPerformance Boost: Lowering simulation distance reduces the load on your system. Great for low-end PCs or mobile devices.Better Automation: Need distant redstone machines or farms to keep running? Crank it up.Mob Behavior: Affects spawning, despawning, and even the way mobs interact in your world.Now letâs get into the how-to, based on your Minecraft version.Changing Simulation Distance in Java EditionWorks on: Windows, macOS, LinuxLaunch Minecraft Java.Go toOptionsâVideo Settings.Look for âSimulation Distanceâ Slider.Set It Anywhere from5 to 32 Chunks.ClickDone. Jump into your world.Pro tip:Java lets you run massive farms even while exploring far-off lands. Just make sure your PC can handle it.How To Change Simulation Distance In Minecraft Bedrock 1.20Changing Simulation Distance in Bedrock EditionWorks on:Windows 10, Mobile, ConsoleStart a World: Create a new one or edit an existing save.Advanced Settings: Scroll to the âAdvancedâ tab in the world options.Find Simulation Distance: Youâll see a dropdownâtypically ranges from 4 to 12 chunks.Pick Your Number: Choose what suits your playstyle and device.Save and Play: Hit the Play button, and you're good to go!Tip: Playing multiplayer on Bedrock?

        "Content": "A shooting scene from MarathonMarathoncould become Bungieâs next big IP to take the world by storm, and a gameplay reveal is coming soon as of writing. After years of success with Destiny 2,Bungieis all set to revive a classic that became popular in the 90s. Technology has changed, so itâs only fair to expect the same from the revamped Marathon series. This guide will provide you with all the necessary information to note.What is Marathon?The original Marathon trilogy was released by Bungie between 1994 and 1997 on MacOS. The classic is going to be returning after a 27 year hiatus in new shape and form, after it was believed that the project might have been canceled.Unlike Destiny 2, Marathon will be focused more on the PvP side of things. There will be slight PvE elements as well, but players will largely be battling between themselves.Marathon gameplay revealThe first major reveal for the gameplay will take place on April 12. Here are the timings for all major parts of the world.10 AM PT1 PM ET6 PM UTC10:30 PM ISTThe gameplay reveal will take place on thegameâs official Twitch account. Viewers can watch the stream by clicking on this link on the correct date.Marathon release dateA release date for the upcoming title is yet to be confirmed. Bungie hasnât previously announced a timeline, so itâs safe to assume 2026 is a possible window. Then again, it could drop late in 2025, depending on the stage of its developmental cycle.Will Marathon have a single-player?Based on the currently available information, Marathon will be a multiplayer-only experience. Unlike Destiny 2, there wonât be any single-player campaign. That said, a co-op campaign could eventually make its way to the game (yet to be confirmed).This is what Christopher Barrett (Game Director) had to say about the upcoming projectâs foundation.\"The heart of Marathonâs gameplay experience is PvP but it isnât the entire story. Weâre building a rich, immersive world that will have ample opportunities for exploration and conflict â both against other players and AI-controlled enemies. Combine that with the different objectives and motivations that players will have for each run, as well as the narrative doors that can be unlocked as players discover things and accomplish tasks, and it creates this really rich palette of gameplay possibilities that will only continue to grow and evolve.\"Is Marathon going to be a sequel?The upcoming game isnât going to be a direct sequel, and this has been confirmed by Bungie. Players wonât have to sit through the original trilogy before picking up the new game. While knowledge from the OG trilogy will help, the sequel will be a standalone experience.Get the latestIPL 2025updates onTimes of India, includingmatch schedules,team squads,points tableandIPL live scoreforCSK,MI,RCB,KKR,SRH,LSG,DC,GT,PBKS, andRR.

        "Content": "Representative ImageCybersecurityexperts have discovered a newphishing campaignthat is targeting Mac users. According to a report by the cybersecurity companyLayerX Labs, experts have discovered that hackers using this phishing campaign, which originally attacked Windows users, are now targeting Mac users after Windows users received an Edge browser update. With these phishing attacks, hackers are reportedly tricking users into believing their Mac is compromised to steal their username and password.How hackers are using this phishing campaign against Mac usersThe report said that in this phishing campaign, hackers usefake security warningsthat pop up on usersâ screens while they are browsing, displaying messages that their Mac is âcompromisedâ and âlocked.âTo raise panic â a tactic used by sophisticated attackers â hackers make the webpage appear frozen. A window then prompts users to enter their Macâs username, password, and phone number for supposed \"support.\"In the report, LayerX Labs shared a screenshot of the phishing attempt, though attackers may change the alert to make it more convincing, cybersecurity experts warned.The fake warning has noticeable red flags, such as a design that doesnât match Appleâs style and the incorrect formatting of âmacOSâ, however, they may not be apparent for many users.As per the report, users can encounter these hackers accidentally by mistyping URLs in their browsers. These typos redirect them to compromised domain parking pages hosting the phishing scam.The report also noted that the phishing attack initially targeted Windows users. However, after Microsoft, Google and Mozilla introduced new security measures in their browsers to block the threat, attackers shifted their focus to Mac users.How Mac users can protect themselves from this phishing campaignIn the report, the cybersecurity experts have also advised users to verify URLs before visiting websites and bookmark frequently used ones to avoid typing errors.It also suggests using a search engine to find websites, as this can help identify typos and direct users to the correct URL.

        "Content": "Rating: 4/5With every iteration, Appleâs MacBook Air M4 brings a substantial advancement in performance and features.Applekeeps the design formula simple: thin and lightweight. The latest MacBook Air comes equipped with the potent new M4 chip, expanded memory options, and an impressive Liquid Retina display. Catering to students, professionals, and casual users alike, the MacBook Air M4 combines speed, portability, and elegance.However, the question remains: does it make sense to upgrade from an M1 or M2 MacBook Air? Is it a machine that will tempt Windows PC users to jump ship? Hereâs our detailed review of Appleâs new MacBook Air.DesignMaintaining its signature minimalist aesthetic, the MacBook Air M4 boasts a slim profile at just 0.44 inches thick and weighs approximately 1.24 kg, making it exceptionally portable. The introduction of the Sky Blue colour option adds a fresh touch to the lineup, alongside the classic Silver, Starlight, and Midnight finishes. The unibody construction, crafted from 100% recycled aluminum, exudes durability and environmental consciousness. The device features two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left side, capable of supporting up to two external displays, alongside a MagSafe charging port. On the right, a 3.5mm headphone jack remains available. While the design hasn't changed from its predecessors, the build quality and aesthetics continue to impress.Apple's Magic Keyboard on the MacBook Air M4 offers a comfortable typing experience with well-spaced keys and excellent tactile feedback. The backlit keys facilitate ease of use in various lighting conditions, and the inclusion of a Touch ID sensor in the power button enhances security and convenience. Just below the full-size Magic Keyboard, you will find the large Force Touch trackpad. The trackpad on theApple MacBook Air M4is large, responsive, and precise, making it a joy to use for gestures and navigation. Undoubtedly, the keyboard and trackpad combination remains one of the best in the industry.DisplayThe Apple MacBook Air M4 is available in two distinct display sizesâ13.3 inches and 15.3 inchesâcatering to varied user preferences for portability or a larger viewing experience. The model reviewed here features the impressive 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, boasting a high resolution of 2880Ã1864 pixels. The display offers up to 500 nits of brightness, support for over 1 billion colors, and an impressive resolution that doubles that of comparable PC laptops. The display excels in delivering vibrant colors and sharp, lifelike details, making it ideal for tasks ranging from casual browsing to professional video editing. The high brightness levels ensure visibility in different lighting conditions, making it suitable for both indoor use and bright outdoor settings. True Tone and P3 wide color gamut support further enhance the viewing experience, providing natural color adjustments and a richer palette for creative work.However, while the display delivers stunning visual performance, it does lack an anti-glare option. This omission might pose challenges in environments with strong light sources or reflective surfaces, where glare can occasionally affect visibility. Despite this minor drawback, the spacious 15.3-inch display of the MacBook Air M4 remains a standout feature, providing users with an immersive and highly satisfying viewing experience. Whether for work or leisure, this display is a testament to Apple's commitment to quality and precision.Performance and batteryPowered by the cutting-edge M4 chip, built on a state-of-the-art 3-nanometer process, the Apple MacBook Air M4 delivers substantial performance advancements over its predecessors. Apple offers multiple variants of the 15.3-inch MacBook Air equipped with the M4 chip, and we had the opportunity to test the model featuring 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD. This laptop stands out with computing capabilities that outshine many competitors in the market. The M4 chip integrates a potent 10-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and supports up to 32GB of unified memory, making the MacBook Air M4 up to twice as fast as the M1 version. This remarkable processing power ensures instantaneous application launches and seamless multitasking. The chip excels in managing resource-intensive tasks like 4K video editing, graphic design, and software development, providing a smooth and efficient experience. Enhanced by its neural engine, the M4 chip also optimizes machine learning operations. The laptop's fanless design complements these features by maintaining whisper-quiet operation even under heavy workloads, adding to its appeal.In addition to its performance capabilities, the MacBook Air M4 boasts a 12MP Center Stage camera, designed to enhance video quality significantly. Center Stage ensures that users remain perfectly framed during calls, even as they move, and introduces Desk Viewâa feature that simultaneously displays both the user and an overhead view of their workspace. This functionality is ideal for showcasing DIY projects or presenting prototypes during video meetings, adding versatility to virtual interactions.Furthermore, the MacBook Air M4 delivers an impressive audio experience. Its immersive sound system supports Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos, creating a rich, three-dimensional soundstage for music and movies. Whether it's work or entertainment, the laptop's superior sound quality enhances the overall user experience, cementing its position as a well-rounded, high-performance device.macOS Sequoia, the latest operating system for the MacBook Air M4, introduces a suite of smart and subtle upgrades that enhance the overall user experience. Among its standout features is iPhone Mirroring, which allows seamless control of an iPhone directly from the Mac, bridging the gap between devices. The new Passwords app simplifies password management, offering a secure and intuitive solution. Enhanced split-screen window management and improved Notes functionality further streamline productivity, making multitasking more efficient. While the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence suite of AI features is still in development, the current iteration of macOS Sequoia delivers a polished and user-friendly experience, solidifying its position as a must-have upgrade for Mac users.Along with this, the Apple Intelligence features on the MacBook Air M4 elevate its functionality. These features seamlessly integrate machine learning capabilities into everyday tasks, enhancing productivity and user experience. For instance, the system intelligently optimises performance based on usage patterns, ensuring efficient multitasking and resource allocation. Additionally, advanced tools like real-time transcription, smart photo editing, and predictive text input showcase the potential of AI to simplify complex workflows. With ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, you can harness its expertise to accomplish tasks more efficiently. The service is available for free, with no account creation required. Privacy is a key focusâIP addresses are masked, and OpenAI does not retain user requests. Additionally, you have full control over enabling ChatGPT integration, deciding when to use it, and managing what information is shared.Battery performance is one of the standout aspects of the Apple MacBook Air M4, making it a reliable companion for all-day use. The laptop boasts an impressive capability of providing up to 15 hours of uninterrupted web browsing or 18 hours of video playback on a single charge. Whether you're working remotely, binge-watching your favorite shows, or tackling demanding tasks, the MacBook Air M4 delivers on its promise of endurance and reliability.VerdictThe Apple MacBook Air M4 is a compelling upgrade, especially for those coming from older models like the M1. It combines powerful performance, exceptional battery life, and a stunning display in a lightweight and portable package. While the design remains largely unchanged, the addition of the M4 chip and increased base memory make it a versatile and future-proof choice. Despite lacking some premium features found in the MacBook Pro lineup, such as brighter displays or higher refresh rates, the MacBook Air M4 offers excellent value. Priced at Rs 99,900, it is a strong choice for students, professionals, and casual users seeking a reliable and stylish device."

Bloomberg's MarkGurmanreports the redesign will be the most substantial change to iOS since the introduction of iOS 7 in 2013.Similarly, iPadOS 19 will receive the same extensive visual refresh, aiming to create a more unified experience across Apple's ecosystem. The tablet operating system will adopt design elements that better align with both iOS and macOS, making transitions between devices more seamless.The Mac platform won't be left behind, with macOS 16 (codenamed \"Cheer\") getting its most significant redesign since macOS Big Sur in 2020. According to Gurman, the updated design language across all three platforms will be loosely inspired by visionOS, the operating system powering Apple's Vision Pro headset.The redesign is reportedly being overseen by Alan Dye, Apple's Vice President of Design, who previously helped craft iOS 7 and watchOS. Gurman notes that primary goal of Apple behind this redesign is to bring greater consistency to its software platforms, making the experience more cohesive when moving between iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. However, Apple isn't planning to merge its operating systems, preferring to maintain separation while unifying their appearance.The next iterations of the OS updates should be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2025, and that is when we could expect to have our first look at redesign."

However, performance may be limited due to the age of these Macs.- CrossOver: CrossOver is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows applications on macOS. To use CrossOver, download and install the software from Codeweavers' website. Then, install Steam through CrossOver, and search for and install Palworld within Steam. Enable D3DMetal and MSync in CrossOver's settings for the Steam app and relaunch Steam to open Palworld. You may need to adjust the graphics settings in Palworld to optimize performance.- Whisky: Whisky is another Wine-based compatibility layer that is free to download and use. Download the latest version of Whisky, move it to your Applications folder, and open it. If prompted, install Apple's Game Porting Toolkit or Rosetta. Create a new \"bottle,\" give it a name, and choose the required Windows version.

        "Content": "Googleis reportedly developing new external display management tools forAndroid16. With these tools, the tech giant may further push Android to transform from a mobile operating system into a usable desktop interface. These upcoming features are expected to enhance Android's compatibility with traditional PC input methods and external monitors, bridging the gap between mobile and desktop experiences. This builds upon Google's previous efforts, such as the addition of an External Display settings page in the last Android version, which allowed users to adjust resolution and rotation.While past updates were a step in the right direction, Google's latest testing in Android 16 indicates a more significant drive toward feature parity with established desktop operating systems like Windows, macOS, and even Chrome OS, especially in external display management capabilities.How Google may make external display management better with Android 16Currently, when users connect the latestGoogle Pixelmodels to an external display, they can mirror the screen. By adjusting certain developer options, they can extend the screen instead, allowing the external display to show a basic desktop-like interface rather than mirroring the phone's screen.However, extending the screen from an Android phone to an external display works differently than on PC operating systems. The mouse remains fixed to one screen and cannot move between displays.Additionally, Android doesn't allow switching between mirroring and extending the screen, requiring users to modify developer options and reconnect the phone to change display modes.According to a report by Android Authority, Google is working on improvements to solve these issues with external display management in Android 16. One of the planned features will reportedly allow mouse cursor transitions across connected displays, along with the ability to rearrange them.Another addition is said to include a toggle to switch between mirroring the built-in display and extending it. However, these features are not yet enabled in the latest Android 16 Beta 2.1 release, the report notes.A demonstration of these features in the report shows a Pixel 8 Pro connected to an external display, the NexDock XL, with Androidâs External Display settings accessed on the phone.Initially, the system recognises the Pixelâs screen as being positioned below the NexDock, requiring vertical touchpad swipes to move the cursor between displays. After adjusting the screen placement in settings, the cursor can transition horizontally between displays as expected."
