        "Content": "Representative imageThere have been many questions over the past few months over whether Indiaâs IT sector will survive the AI wave, whether the 1.5 million engineering graduates we produce every year will be made redundant by AI-driven automation. The reality is, humanity is where it is today because of our ability to adapt, and that will likely continue. Except this time, with AI, we may have to adapt quicker than ever before.In many ways, that is happening behind the scenes, saysGanesh Gopalan, CEO & co-founder of Gnani. ai. âOur country is, in fact, one of the most innovative in adopting AI. The boardroom sanction for AI is far higher in India than many places in the world, because India is so value-obsessed. They want to see what AI systems can do, and theyâll invest if they see the potential. We look at business problems and say, âHow can we solve them?â And often, weâll use AI behind the scenes.âHe points to real-world use cases as proof that Indian organisations care deeply about quick outcomes. âWe work with more than 100 financial services customers,â he continues, âand we build AI-based agents that help, for instance, to automate tasks like lending or reconciling claims. We donât always talk about AI in the marketing pitch. We say, âWe will help you collect more money at a lower cost,â and behind it, we use AI. Thatâs how you see real adoption.âChanging labour marketYet, whispers of doom persist, especially around jobs. Indian ITâs bread-and-butter so far lay in providing large teams of coders who do repetitive tasks, the kind that might be replaced or drastically reduced by code-writing AI. âIt is already happening,â saysAmit Chaurasia, founder of Dataneers. âFor a particular task, if I had to hire ten engineers, maybe I will hire two or three. The code generation can happen automatically. But those two or three people need to be experienced. I would rather hire a senior engineer who can review the code. And if the software is complex, I definitely need that experienced person to deal with potential gaps or security issues the AI might not address. So experienced developers will be in demand, because no matter how advanced these large language models become, there are many layers of complexity that still require human oversight.âChaurasiaâs point underscores a shift in the labour market. âBy the time we reach a point where AI is writing all code, we donât know how thoroughly tested or secure that code will be,â he says. âBut already, the job requirement is changing from âwrite these thousands of lines of codeâ to âinspect, secure, and integrate them.ââHe notes that more junior roles might come under strain, but that a new generation of engineering graduates can nonetheless plan ahead. âI tell students: be aware that AI tools are available. You can stand out if you learn how to use them effectively. There is plenty of room for creativity in everything from advanced systems programming to data storage. But if you are not curious and if you do not keep learning, you will be left behind.âAt the same time, AI can spawn fresh opportunities. âWe are at the cusp of something substantial,â says Gopalan. âWhen you need custom solutions, especially in local languages for large companies in BFSI, retail, telecom, or manufac turing, you canât simply rely on an off-the-shelf large language model. You need domain-specific solutions. That means a lot of people building smaller, tailored models, writing front-end integrations, or training them on local data, which can be a lot more involved. Itâs not all about one giant LLM.â He adds that the same synergy is likely to produce new roles in prompt engineering, AI design, domain strategy, and more. âThe combination of domain expertise plus AI knowledge is a winner. We are seeing that with every new project.âAmit Walia, CEO of Informatica, too, says the job market has expansions in store. âWe need cloud security professionals. We need people with deep knowledge of large language models, as well as the folks who can handle areas like data governance. So, yes, some jobs might vanish, but the old story of technology is that every time it disrupts some roles, it tends to create new ones in areas we had never anticipated. And that story continues.âEducation, upskilling are concernsSonica Aron, founder & CEO of HR advisory Marching Sheep, points out that Indian ITâs strength has long been its capacity to adapt. âWhile AI is reshaping the sector, Indian IT firms have likewise adapted and evolved.âThe concern, she says, is that we still produce 1.5 million engineering graduates every year, many of whom do not receive training in the advanced areas that AI demands. âThere is a mismatch,â she says. âBut it can be addressed with the right partnerships and upskilling efforts. Those who reskill and align themselves with these emerging AI-based roles will find the future bright.âSome senior Indian IT execs say the engineering chops of fresh graduates leaves a lot to be desired. The danger is that in the age of AI, these new cohorts could be left behind if not properly upskilled.Indiaâs well-known service-based mindset has come under criticism too. Some fear that, by focusing on tasks that require only incremental innovation, Indian firms may miss out on building truly original AI products. âWeâre simply fulfilling the needs of large clients,â saysChaurasia, âinstead of investing in original research or deep tech product development. Investors here are usually more comfortable with safer, smaller bets. That can delay progress. We always hope for big leaps, but you need the environment that encourages it. Where is that fundamental research happening? Primarily in the West, or in China.âBut the field today is a lot more level than it used to be. Gopalan notes that âeverything is accessible,â thanks to open-source tools and the cloud. âWe no longer have the disadvantage we used to have in the late 90s or early 2000s, where if you were a student in India, you didnât have the same software environment as an MIT student. Now you do. Thatâs huge. We just have to seize that advantage.â"

        "Content": "Unless youâve been living under a rock, chances are youâve seen your social media feeds flooded with dreamy, hand-drawn-style portraits. From fans to Bollywood celebrities, everyone seems to be jumping on the latest trendâturning iconic film moments and personal pictures into images inspired by StudioGhibliâs signature animation style.What exactly is this Ghibli trend?It all started withChatGPTâs latest image-generation tool, which can instantly turn any photo into a Ghibli-style creation with just the right prompt. Instagram, X, Facebookâyou name itâare full of âGhibli-fiedâ snaps. While many see it as a tribute toHayao Miyazakiâs legendary animation style, others believe itâs crossing the line.For long-time fans, these AI-made images are a way to honour the meticulously crafted works of Miyazaki, whose films take years to make, every frame drawn with immense care and precision. But with OpenAI now offering users the power to mimic his style in seconds, a growing number of voices are raising concerns about creativity, ethics and copyright.The debate has become especially heated as artists, musicians and filmmakers weigh in:Singer and composerVishal Dadlanididnât mince his words, calling the trend âAI plagiarisationâ. On Instagram, he wrote: âSorry I'm not sharing any of the Studio Ghibli style images you guys have made of or for me. I just can't bring myself to support AI's plagiarisation of an artist's life's work.\" He also touched upon another pressing issueâthe environmental impact of AIâsaying, âNot to mention, the environmental horror that those images are. Please do NOT make any more. Thank you.\"SingerArmaan Malikechoed similar sentiments. When a fan asked him during an AMA on X whether heâd tried Ghibli art, he replied, âI thought it was a cute thing when it began but I donât like the fact that the original Ghibli Studio design language was being horribly misused. I donât like when creators and artists gets taken advantage of.âHollywoodâs new friend? AI on the big screenWhile AI is taking over social media feeds with dreamy filters, itâs also quietly making its way into the very heart of Hollywood. What was once seen as the villain in science fiction is now becoming a studioâs right hand. AI is being used for visual effects, voice manipulation and even fine-tuning actorsâ performances.At the 2025 Oscars, films like Emilia Perez and The Brutalist showcased AIâs growing role in filmmaking. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for Best Actor with help from AI, which refined his Hungarian accent in The Brutalist. Technology is even helping to de-age actors likeTom Hanksand Harrison Ford for the screen.But while some embrace AI as a filmmaking revolution, others are pushing backâhardOver 400 Hollywood stars urged Donald Trump to protect artists' copyrighted workJust weeks ago, over 400 Hollywood starsâincluding Paul McCartney,Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, and Guillermo del Toroâsigned a letter urging the US government to protect copyright from being eroded by AI. As per Deadline, the letter arrived in response to tech giants OpenAI and Google submitting proposals for an AI Action Plan to the Trump administration.The letter warned, âAmericaâs global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries.â It highlighted that the entertainment industry supports over 2.3 million jobs and brings in over $229 billion in wages annually. The celebrities accused AI companies of âundermining this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.âNames like Bette Midler, Paul Giamatti, Rosario Dawson, Ayo Edebiri, Dan Levy, andJustine Batemanalso appeared on the list of signatories, standing firm in their opposition.As per BBC, the real issue isnât the technology, but those who are building it. AI models are often trained using publicly available data, which includes copyrighted works shared online, sometimes without the creatorsâ knowledge or permission. OpenAI, Google and other tech giants are now facing several lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, all claiming their work has been used without consent. Writers have also urged studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal to step in, but so far, none have taken legal action. Meanwhile, tech giants are asking the government to classify copyrighted material as âfair useâ so it can legally be used to train AIâarguing that this is essential to stay ahead in the global AI race, especially against countries like China.What jobs in film industry could AI take over? Hereâs what ChatGPT answeredWhen asked which roles in the entertainment industry AI could easily take over or automate, OpenAIâs ChatGPT provided a detailed list. Some of the most vulnerable areas include basic scriptwriting, such as formula-based stories, childrenâs shows, or low-budget thrillers. AI can produce fast drafts, though it still struggles with emotional depth. It can also assist with storyboarding and concept art using tools like Midjourney or DALLÂ·E, helping directors visualise scenes quickly.Background animation and CGI extras are also easy targets. AI can create entire crowds, fantasy landscapes or city scenes without needing teams of animators. Other areas include dubbing and voiceovers, where AI can replicate voices in various languagesâor even bring back the voices of late actors.Subtitling, translations, and editing assistanceâlike picking the best shots for a trailer or colour gradingâcan also be handled by AI efficiently. Even casting suggestions can be made using algorithms based on scripts and past performances.However, roles like directing, acting, cinematography, and production design are still difficult to replace. While AI can support these jobs, the creativity, emotion, and artistic eye of a human being remain irreplaceableâfor now.âNothing will be originalâ: Amar Kaushik sounds the alarmFilmmaker Amar Kaushik, known for âStreeâ and its hit sequel, shared his views in a chat with Komal Nahata. âArtificial intelligence cannot replace writers. It's the work of the mindâ¦ Your originality will not be thereâ¦ Some or the other person will catch you. Okay, it took this from that filmâ¦ So nothing will be original. And the human brain has the power to produce original.âMiyazakiâs warning: âAn insult to life itselfâPerhaps no voice on this topic has been as strong as Hayao Miyazakiâs himself. Years ago, the master animator said he found AI in animation âutterly disgustingâ and called it âan insult to life itself.â He firmly stated that he would ânever wish to incorporate this technology into [his] work at all.â Yet today, AI-generated content in his style is everywhere.As the lines between homage and theft continue to blur, the question looms more extensive than ever: is AI paying tribute, or is it robbing artists of their lifeâs work?"

        "Content": "AR Rahmanis known for mixing traditional Indian music with world beats and beautiful melodies, creating a new style that touches peopleâs hearts. From the memorable music of 'Roja' to the worldwide hit 'Slumdog Millionaire', his songs have reached people everywhere. Rahmanâs music keeps growing and changing but always stays full of feeling, creativity, and spirit. Recently, in an interview, he also shared how he uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) to help make music.Rahmanâs Views on AI in Music CompositionTalking to Bollywood Bubble,Rahmanexpressed his views on using AI to compose music. He compared it to the idea of constructing a building without any human involvement, which he said is impossible. He explained that human intervention is essential, especially since a director cannot spend time operating AI tools to generate music. Instead, the director needs to focus on many other aspects of the project. Rahman emphasized the importance of having someone who can carefully manage the mix and tune, much like a mother caring for the music. He also pointed out that trying to save money by removing the composer from the process is foolish.The Importance of Leadership and CollaborationHe explained that trying to do everything alone can actually harm the quality and intensity of oneâs work. He believes that leadership and collaboration will always be essential. Rahman mentioned that he would never replace a talented sitar player like AnushkaShankaror Asad Khan with an AI-generated version, calling it foolish to substitute something brilliant with a mediocre machine-made copy. He prefers using the real artist rather than relying on artificial creations that lack originality and feel like âFrankenstein-like leftoversâ of human creativity. However, he did acknowledge that some aspects of generative art can be quite impressive.AI as a Tool for EmpowermentHe concluded by explaining that AI offers empowerment to people who lack the resources to create or shoot content, allowing them to make movies or documentaries from a simple room. This is especially valuable for topics that might not receive funding otherwise. He believes itâs a great idea to encourage children to use AI to express themselves or create stories. He mentioned that Shekharji came up with this idea, which he fully supported. He also said he plans to speak withSam Altmanto explore ways to empower these young creators. He acknowledged that while some people use AI for positive and empowering purposes, others might misuse it to produce cheap or vulgar content, highlighting the difference between good and bad intentions in AI use."

        "Content": "\"Change is the only constant.\" The age-old adage has found new significance in the modern workforce. Since artificial intelligence first knocked on the corporate doors, it has successfully altered the very face of the workplace. The changes, once a perennial truth, have transformed into a \"new norm.\" According to LinkedIn, a staggering 70% of the skills required in most professions will undergo a radical redefinition by 2030. AI continues to make its presence felt in every industry, reshaping the workspace in an entirely different manner. It is now an urgent necessity for professionals to brace for the inevitable change.WhileAI literacyand technical prowess remain the cherished keywords of the job market, an intriguing trend has emerged: the increasing prevalence of soft skillsâthanks to AI. In a world that is learning to co-exist with artificial intelligence, it is the \"human element\" that demarcates us from this new presence. This serves as a clarion call to enshrine and refine those inherently human qualities that enable us to connect, communicate, and innovate.As we teeter on the edge of a new era in work, the key to survival lies in mastering the competencies shaping the next decade. In this volatile workspace, adapting is no longer a luxury but an imperative.Core competencies for the 2030 workforce: A closer lookAs the workforce catapults, some skills are being shrugged under the carpet as obsolete, while others are emerging as king of the job market. Artificial intelligence, while the most obvious force driving the evolution, is not the sole factor at play. In fact, several other core competencies have already begun to take center stage, coming forth as essential to thrive in the professional arena.Here is a list of core competencies that you need to master to survive in the volatile and ever-changing world of work.AI LiteracyWhy it matters:Since the advent of artificial intelligence, it has never failed to arrest the attention of all the professionals of the world and dominate the headlines. From content generation to predictive analytics, AIâs imprint on the workspace is undeniable. Regardless of your profession, having a firm grasp of artificial intelligence is mandatory. The ability to understand and wield AI tools will be the critical differentiator between those who merely keep up and those who lead the charge.What to do:Deepen your knowledge of AI through formal learning avenuesâwhether thatâs mastering machine learning models or learning how to leverage AI for problem-solving. AI literacy isnât just a technical skill; itâs a mindset that will determine how you approach the work itself.Strategic ThinkingWhy it matters:We are currently dwelling in a world marked by unprecedented changes. It has become a norm. The organisations that will succeed are the ones that can see beyond immediate needs and anticipate future trends. Strategic thinking will enable you to map out paths to growth amidst the unpredictable tides of technological disruption and economic uncertainty.What to do:Foster your ability to think beyond short-term goals by studying business trends, market forecasts, and the disruptive technologies on the horizon. Cultivate a forward-thinking mentality that prepares you for shifts, allowing your organization to not just adapt but also innovate.CommunicationWhy it matters:Communication is the king of the job market. With the rise of virtual teams and global collaboration,communication skillsare more critical than ever. Ideas that once thrived in physical boardrooms now need to be communicated across emails, video calls, and project management software. Clear, concise, and persuasive communication will be your tool for building influence and securing buy-in for ideas.What to do:In addition to honing verbal and written communication, focus on mastering digital communication tools that enhance collaboration in virtual and hybrid settings. Additionally, understand the nuances of non-verbal communication in virtual spaces, where much of the interaction is mediated through screens.AdaptabilityWhy it matters:Adaptability is no longer a \"nice-to-have\" traitâitâs a survival mechanism. As industries undergo rapid transformations and new technologies emerge, professionals who thrive will be those who can embrace change, pivot when necessary, and make the most of uncertain circumstances. In the post-pandemic world, the ability to manage shifting priorities and navigate evolving job expectations will be essential.What to do:Begin embracing discomfort and uncertainty as opportunities for growth. Push yourself to engage with new ideas, tools, and workflows. By developing a flexible mindset and continuously learning, youâll be poised to turn disruptions into competitive advantages.Large Language Models (LLM) ProficiencyWhy it matters:LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, are revolutionizing industries by transforming how data is processed and how we interact with technology. From automating customer service to generating content, LLMs are becoming indispensable in the workplace. Professionals skilled in utilizing these models will be positioned at the forefront of the next wave of innovation.What to do:Gain a deep understanding of how large language models work, their practical applications, and how they can be leveraged to streamline processes and generate value. This technical acumen will be crucial in roles related to data science, content creation, and even client-facing positions.Problem Solvingand Innovative ThinkingWhy it matters:AI can solve all your problems. The current generation has started believing in this theorem. However, it needs a balanced approach. You cannot sideline AIâs power but must not heavily rely on it to, or your problem-solving skills will corrode. Those who can not only identify problems but also propose inventive solutions will be the ones driving transformative change. These professionals will be invaluable, especially in roles that require navigating ambiguity and crafting new strategies.What to do:Cultivate a mindset of inquiry. Donât just seek solutionsâseek novel solutions that challenge conventional wisdom. Try to dig out the âwhyâ of everything. Engage in cross-disciplinary learning and work, as innovation often happens when ideas collide from diverse fields.Relationship BuildingWhy it matters:Humans survive through connections. In a world that is increasingly driven by automation and AI, human relationships will form the backbone of an organisation. Whether itâs managing a team, engaging clients, or negotiating deals, building and maintaining meaningful relationships will always be a core competency in the workforce.What to do:Invest in your emotional intelligence and learn how to manage relationships with empathy, authenticity, and tact. The ability to build trust, communicate effectively, and resolve conflicts will be essential as collaboration becomes more distributed and digital.Regional differences: Whatâs hot in your country?The fastest-growing skills aren't the same everywhere. Different regions and industries are placing emphasis on skills that suit their unique economic and job market dynamics. For instance:In India: Innovation, creativity, and code review are emerging as essential skills, particularly as the country continues to expand its tech sector.In Brazil: Strategic thinking, customer retention, and trade policy skills are on the rise, reflecting the country's global economic positioning.In the UK and US: AI literacy, communication, and relationship-building are becoming pivotal as these countries continue to lead in tech-driven economies.The rise of emerging rolesEmerging roles require a set of competencies that are distinctively different from traditional job functions. Whether itâs the growing demand for data analysts in France or the rise of travel advisors in Spain, these new positions will demand specialized skills, with a particular emphasis on the following:Customer Engagement in Business DevelopmentLarge Language Models (LLM) Expertise in IT and EngineeringHealth Information Management in HealthcareUpskilling is the only way forwardWith new skills emerging on the fore, continuous learning is no longer a choice but a survival mechanism. As professionals, the onus is on us to ensure that we evolve with the change mechanism. According to LinkedIn, a significant majority of learning and development (L&D) professionals emphasize that upskilling and reskilling are now more critical than ever. With the rise of AI, soft skills will continue to be just as crucial as technical expertise."

AI is making life easier, faster, and more creative. But as this powerful tool becomes more accessible, people are starting to experiment with it in areas that raise caution. While AI can help with research, and drafting documents, the line gets blurry when it starts replacing the role of human beings.Recently, a similar case happened in New York, where a man used anAI-generated avatarto present his case without informing the court. This was followed by a mix of shock, anger, and embarrassment that was a stark reminder that while AI is innovative, it cannot replace human control.The court came to a halt last month when 74-year-oldJerome Dewaldtried arguing his case using an AI-generated avatar. Dewald, who was representing himself in an employment dispute before the New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division's First Judicial Department, left judges in shock when it became clear the person speaking on screen wasnât real.âIt may please the court, I come here todayâ¦â the avatar begins, sounding composed and human-like. The digital figure on the screen bore a strong resemblance to a younger version of Dewald, who was seated off-camera.PollDo you think AI should be allowed to represent individuals in court cases?No, it undermines human authorityYes, it's innovativeThe confusion began when one of the judges asked Dewald whether the man on the screen was his lawyer. The court had previously approved Dewald to represent himself, so the presence of a separate figure was unexpected. Dewald casually responded, âI generated that,â adding, âThat is not a real person.âJustice Sallie Manzanet-Daniels, who was quite displeased with being uninformed about it, abruptly shut down the hearing. âIt would have been nice to know that when you made your application,â she said, her tone firm. âI donât appreciate being misled,â she added before demanding, âShut that off.âThe moment quickly went viral online, as an X user posted the clipping with the caption, âA judge in New York was pi**ed off after a plaintiff tried using anAI lawyer, complete with an avatar.âAccording to the New York Times, Dewald sent a letter of apology to the judges. âMy intent was never to deceive but rather to present my arguments in the most efficient manner possible,â he explained. âHowever, I recognize that proper disclosure and transparency must always take precedence.âPhoto Credits: X"

He believesAI toolsare democratizing access to software creation, allowing beginners to accomplish more with less technical knowledge.AI tools make it easier to get into software development, says Github CEO\"It's so much easier to get into software development. You can just write a prompt into Copilot or ChatGPT or similar tools, and it will likely write you a basic webpage, or a small application, a game inPython,\" he explained.This democratization is enabling smaller teams to tackle larger projects. \"You see some of the early signs of that, where very small startups â sometimes five developers and some of them actually only one developer â believe they can become million, if not billion dollar businesses by leveraging all the AI agents that are available to them,\" Dohmke noted.While some developers worry about job displacement as AI makes smaller teams more productive, Dohmke remains optimistic. In a January blog post, he acknowledged that \"the anxiety is understandable,\" but reminded that \"developers have discovered how to channel the new capabilities into entire domains of innovation that didn't exist before.\"For established programmers, Dohmke advisescontinuous learning: \"You got to keep rehearsing. You got to keep training. You got to keep learning. You're never done with learning.\""

With new developments being launched in AI each and every day, people across the globe are excited about just what artificial intelligence can do for them. From converting images of people into its StudioGhibliversion to now creating a mini-episode of the iconic cartoon series, Tom and Jerry, AI is climbing levels of success every day.An animated short of Tom and Jerry was created using TTT-MLP, a new AI tool developed by Stanford and NVIDIA. As per Artificial Intelligence News, the tool can create one-minute-long animated videos just from text prompts. In the video going viral on the Internet, a person put the prompt: \"Tom chases Jerry through NYC office chaos\"The tool generated a hilarious video where Tom was seen arriving at an office, entering an elevator and settling at his desk. But Jerry damages a wire and thus sparks the famous cat and mouse chase loved by fans for years.PollDo you think AI-generated animations can ever replace traditional animation?No, traditional animation is irreplaceableYes, AI can do it betterSocial Media ReactionImage credits: Instagram/artificialintelligencenews.inWhile the video garnered praise for its impressive use of AI, netizen's reaction to it has been mixed.Many in the comments claimed that the original version was better and AI should just let the cartoon be, writing, \"Nah we're good with original ones\" and \"It's not so funny... The real is better\"Others commented how the original makers' effort and craftsmanship were being ridiculed by these AI versions writing, \"The original animators are turning in their graves.\" and \"Although I do respect the tech advancement, I hate that real talented artists will get overlooked and everyone would forget HONORABLE CRAFTSMANSHIP. \"Some people also questioned how the use of AI for animation would affect the job prospects for animators who put in years' worth of study and practice to hone their skills and create animated content that is appreciated by the people. \"Looks soulless in my opinion... I am worried about animators who have a unique art style and this will just steal all their effort.\"Many in the comments section also compared how first it was Ghibli who had to face AI animation and now it was Tom and Jerry. \"WE DONâT NEED MORE ILLUSIONS OR ENTERTAINMENT OR NON-REALITY. WE NEED VIRTUE AND COMMUNITY.\" \"So more trash instead of art!\""

        "Content": "The songs today lack in soul, they have lost the charm. Itâs not the way the melodies were earlier. These are a few common complaints that audiences often make when it comes toBollywood music. Weighing in on the matter, musical artistShantanu Moitra, who is known for his powerful and beautiful work in movies like âThree Idiots,â â12th Fail,â and more, told Namrata Kohli, âWe as human beings love shortcuts. Some shortcuts work, but most shortcuts donât work.âTechnology and responsibilityâWhen we would cry as children, our mothers would tell us a story or sing a lullaby. Todayâs mother replaces this with her mobile and engages with her other work and puts the song on I-pad. But when the mother was singing, she was conscious and responsible for what she was saying or singing. I feel that Technology is great â but we have to use technology with responsibility, and that is the biggest crisis we are facing at the moment,â he added.The sad realityThen, citing a relatable example, he continued, âToday, if a person goes to a forest, he asks his guide â \"Tiger dikhega. If you are not able to show me one, then I will not pay you money.\" Now look at the ecosystem. He has no interest in the other species. He feels his trip would have been a big failure if he had not seen the tiger. This has all come from the communication we have created in the world.âWe have created the Frankenstein?âSo we have created the Frankenstein! And then we complain about the Frankenstein. I think my job, my songs, and my creations are all about making melodies. Whatever technology you get, AI you get, but if my melody can put a tear in your eyes or put a smile on your face, my job is done,â he concluded."

        "Content": "Hyderabad: Want to build robots, create smart assistants, or develop apps that âthink' on their own? A degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) might just be your calling. Once a niche, AI has rapidly become one of the most sought-after courses in engineering colleges acrossTelanganaâ and demand is only growing.Since the introduction of emerging tech courses in 2020, AI has steadily gained traction. Today, it ranks second only toComputer Science Engineering(CSE) in terms of seat availability â offering around 17,000 seats under the convenor quota amongCSEand IT-related branches.AI is offered under five different subject codes, allowing students to pair it with specialisations such as Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). This flexibility enables a broader and more dynamic academic experience. In total, there are 17 courses under the CSE and IT umbrella, with a combined intake of 61,587 seats. Additionally, 20% more seats are available through the management and NRI quotas.\"Last year, parents shelled out up to Rs 25 lakh in donations â excluding annual fees â just to secure a seat in AI,\" said Srinivas Varma D, a faculty member at a private engineering college in Hyderabad. \"This year too, the rush hasn't slowed. The demand is skyrocketing.\"He added that even before Class 12 results are announced or engineering college affiliations are finalised, he's already received over 45 calls from parents eager to reserve an AI seat for their children.Who should pursue AI?For those eyeing AI as a career path, both academic and industry experts emphasise the importance of strong mathematical aptitude, problem-solving abilities, and a good grasp of at least one programming language.\"If students have these foundational skills, they'll find it easier to learn AI or any CSE specialisation,\" said Y Kiran Chandra, centre head at Viswam.ai, which focuses on building AI solutions for the Global South. \"These core skills â combined with domain knowledge â also enhance employability after graduation.\"However, experts also warn against choosing AI just because it's in vogue. Genuine interest in the subject is essential to succeed.What to look for in a collegeDrawing from the iconic lines of Telugu poet and reformer Gurajada Appa Rao â \"Deshamante Mattikadoi, Deshamante Manushuloi\" (A nation is not made of land, but of its people) â Sriram Venkatesh, secretary of the Telangana Council of Higher Education (TGCHE), said that a college's true strength lies not in its buildings, but in its faculty.\"The first thing students should evaluate is the quality of the faculty and the kind of research being done there. If the faculty is exceptional, it doesn't matter if the college operates from a shed,\" he said.Experts also stress the importance of accreditations like NAAC and NBA, and the type of institution âgovt, autonomous, non-autonomous, or private â as key indicators of academic standards.\"Rankings like the NIRF can offer helpful insights,\" said Vikram Pudi, chair of admissions at IIT-Hyderabad. \"While there are valid debates around their methodology, these rankings still reflect verified data on faculty strength, research output, and infrastructure, making them a good starting point.\"After graduation: Where AI leadsAI graduates today are in high demand across sectors, according to faculty and placement officers.\"AI is clearly the future. Many of our students are being recruited as AI engineers, consultants, and scientists,\" said M Upendra Kumar, a veteran professor in the CSE department with over 25 years of experience. \"The starting pay ranges from Rs 4 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per annum, and students from top-tier colleges are securing even higher packages.\"The scope of AI isn't limited to tech companies. Graduates are increasingly finding roles in healthcare, pharma, education, fintech, retail, and more.Faculty members noted that student projects and internships are increasingly focused on emerging technologies, as students look to gain hands-on experience early in their academic journey.âSkip the hype, follow your type'Vishnu Ramesh didn't pick computer science out of passion. Like many others, it just felt like the default choice after Class 12. Strong in academics, he cleared competitive exams and secured admission to two top institutes in the state, eventually choosing BITS Pilani, Hyderabad.\"I can honestly say I barely studied in the first three years of my BTech,\" he admits. \"Most of my time went into playing basketball and being part of the music team. I had a great social life in college.\" But things shifted dramatically in his third year. During the second semester, he stumbled upon a subject called Computational Geometry â and it changed everything.\"I was fascinated,\" he recalls. \"It was all about vectors, their relationships, grouping â concepts that naturally led into AI-powered search. That subject opened the door to AI for me.\"His interest deepened during an internship at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. From there, there was no looking back.Now 28, Vishnu says most of what he knows about AI was learned on the job â during his internship and while building his first startup, Subtl.ai. The platform helps organisations securely chat with sensitive documents, and counts the State Bank of India and Bharat Dynamics Limited among its clients. He's now gearing up to launch his second venture â this time focused on vertical AI applications.His advice to students considering a career in AI? Be genuinely interested.\"Don't do it just because it's trending,\" he says. \"Only choose AI if you're truly curious about it â otherwise, it's a recipe for failure.\"\"If not for that one subject that sparked my interest, my life could've taken a very different turn.\"Vishnu believes open-source learning has levelled the playing field: \"It no longer matters if you're in an IIT or a tier-3 college. What matters is your interest â and what you're doing to improve yourself.\"His simple mantra for aspiring AI engineers: \"Love the field. Work hard. Stay focused. Learn Python, build cool demos, apply for interviews, get an internship, gain experience â and either land a job or start something of your own.\""
