        "Content": "Ahmedabad: The human rights organisation People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) on Saturday requested theUniform Civil Code(UCC) panel in Guajrat to adopt an inclusiveconsultative approachand transparency. They asserted that having a UCC alone would not guaranteegender equality.In a representation made before the UCC committee's chairperson, Justice (retd) Ranjana Desai, PUCL president (Gujarat) Anand Yagnik and secretary Mujahid Nafees expressed their \"serious reservations on the manner in which UCC is being conceived, the highly inadequate process of consultation with stakeholders, and the absence of a draft that should have captured and furthered the journey towards gender justice and equal rights\".PUCL stated, \"Just having uniform laws will not result in women getting equal rights or in wiping out the discrimination inherent, in various degrees, in these laws. This is because uniformity per se does not mean equality and cannot be equated with equality and justice for women.\"They urged the panel to have balanced and non-politicised reforms and called for avoiding the UCC's use \"as a means to further communal divide, and instead, focus on inclusive legal frameworks that promote social harmony\".PUCL opposed the UCC because it poses a danger to Gujarat's cultural variety. \"A UCC, rather than emphasizing equality, risks erasing cultural identities, creating legal alienation, and deepening social tensions,\" the letter reads.Additionally, PUCL stated that the UCC process has been neither transparent nor inclusive and fails to engage in meaningful consultations with religious and ethnic communities and women's organisations. The organisation also said that the UCC cannot have state-wise variations and termed the state's bid to have a UCC \"a fragmented approach\". \"There is no constitutional requirement to impose the UCC universally on all citizens. Instead, Parliament could consider an opt-in model, allowing individuals to voluntarily adopt the UCC rather than imposing it unilaterally,\" the letter reads."

Shahanaz, a govt school teacher, died on Jan 6, 2014. After examining the evidence, the court ruled that her 89-year-old husband is entitled to 75% share in all her properties, her two brothers to 10%, and the sister 5%.Justice Sanjeevkumar highlighted the differences between Hindu and Muslim personal laws. While Hindu law grants daughters and sons equal inheritance rights and treats wives on par with husbands âaligning with Article 14 of the Constitution â such equality is not reflected in Muslim law.The judge pointed out that in this case, while the brothers are considered âsharersâ under Muslim law, the sister is entitled to share only as a âresiduaryâ, leading to discrimination that does not exist in in Hindu law where âbrothers and sisters have equal rights.â"

        "Content": "Vadodara: A controversy erupted in the city after forms related to a survey on theUniform Civil Code(UCC) were allegedly distributed to students belonging to the minority community in municipal primary schools, without the knowledge of school authorities.According to reports, students were asked to take the forms home and get them signed by their parents, with only names and phone numbers filled in. The issue came to light on Saturday, prompting political intervention and calls for an inquiry.Ashfak Malek, a Congress member, said he first learned of the issue when a concerned parent from Haripura Primary School approached him. \"We verified that the forms match those available on a UCC survey website. The concern is that parents are being asked to sign these forms without any context or explanation, and without the actual survey being filled,\" Malek said.He further alleged that students were warned they would be barred from examinations if they failed to return the signed forms. \"We also found that similar forms were distributed at a municipal school in Tandalja, another minority-dominated area,\" he added, expressing concern that the distribution may have occurred more widely across the city's municipal schools.On Saturday, Malek, along with a group of parents and students, submitted a formal representation to senior officials of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) primary education committee.Responding to the controversy, Shweta Parghi, administrator of municipal schools, said she was unaware of the incident until the complaint was brought to her attention. \"We will initiate an inquiry once schools reopen on Monday. The matter was reported to us after school hours on Saturday,\" she stated."

The govt sought the same timeframe, which the court granted. The court also clubbed all petitions challenging the UCC and scheduled the next hearing in 10 days. So far, more than half a dozen petitions have been filed against the UCC in court.Suresh Singh Negi, a resident of Bhimtal, challenged provisions related to live-in relationships and the alleged disregard of marital customs of Muslims, Parsis and other communities. Elmasuddin Siddiqui from Dehradun filed a petition highlighting the neglect of minority customs.Negi's plea pointed out that while thelegal marriage ageis 21 for men and 18 for women, the UCC allows live-in relationships from the age of 18 for both. He argued that this raises questions about the legitimacy of children born from such relationships. Additionally, the petition noted that while terminating a live-in relationship requires only a simple application and a 15-day waiting period, divorce in a traditional marriage is a lengthy judicial process that can take decades and often mandates full maintenance.Negi's petition further alleged that the UCC infringes uponconstitutional rights, arguing that it might encourage live-in relationships over marriage, as couples could cohabit under favourable circumstances and separate when convenient. Marriage registration has been mandatory since 2010, with non-compliance punishable by up to three months' imprisonment or a fine of Rs 10,000.Another petition claimed that Islamic customs have been overlooked. Under Islamic tradition, a wife observes the Iddat period to pray for her deceased husband's soul, which the UCC allegedly restricts. The petition also stated that while Sharia law permits marriages between close relatives â excluding blood relatives â the UCC does not.A couple in a live-in relationship also filed a petition arguing that the requirement to inform authorities before registering such relationships violates privacy rights. The male petitioner is from Maharashtra, while the female petitioner resides in Ranikhet.Additionally, a Halwani couple has filed a petition challenging the UCC's constitutional validity, while a social activist has submitted a PIL raising concerns about women's rights."

He said the bill was passed without adequate consultation with the stakeholders, which led to considerable controversy. He expressed concern over the govt's actions, stating that they appear to be aimed at curbingminority rightswhile advancing its own agenda. Stating that the SGPC has always been committed to protecting the rights of minorities and opposing any decision that goes against minority communities, Dhami alleged that the central govt previously attempted to suppress minorities through measures such as the introduction of the Uniform Civil Code, which directly interfered with the personal laws and religious beliefs of various communities. Similarly, the Agniveer recruitment scheme, instead of direct recruitment in the Indian Army, is an attempt to take away the reservation rights of minorities, he said."

He also cited the quashing of the regressive triple talaq mode of instant divorce prevalent among Muslim community by the SC in Shayara Bano case (2017) and the judgment giving equal inheritance rights to women.He said, through continuous monitoring, the SC has emerged as protector of forests and environment and has given several rulings for prevention of pollution of water and air while introducing the innovative âpolluter pays principleâ. The SC has also ruled that the right to a healthy environment is part of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21.âThe judiciary has consistently safeguarded womenâs reproductive autonomy, affirming that womenâs control over their own bodies is fundamental to their dignity and their right to life, whether it is in terms of their right to choose abortion or challenging coercive sterilization practices,â Justice Kant said."
