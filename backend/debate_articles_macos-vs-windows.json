        "Content": "Most people who are buying the new MacBooks arenât long-termMacusers, instead, the sale figures are coming from converts who are switching from different desktop platforms And, this isnât just some percentage of the total Mac sales. A new report suggests around half the Mac sales are coming from people who are switching from Windows or Chromebooks.People are preferring Mac over othersApplevs others has been a never-ending debate for over a decade now. And,macOSand Windows rivalry goes back over a couple of decades. However, a new analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) reveals a new trend shift where people are choosing macOS aka Mac devices over Windows PCs or Chromebooks.The study conducted by CIRP dives into the recent purchases of Mac laptops and desktops, especially people who have bought it recently and almost one-third of them have switched to Mac from Windows PCs. And, around 16% of new Mac customers were Chromebook users.Out of total Mac sales, 60% of them were previously users of other desktop platforms.iPhone acts as the gateway for users to theApple ecosystemEven though Mac was the primary product in the iPhone era. Things changed as soon as iPhone was introduced, six years later and it is still driving the entire Apple ecosystem. Now, it acts as a gateway for users to explore the Apple ecosystem, including Mac.Why this could be happeningWhile both Windows and macOS have come a long way, there are a few things that we think could be the reason behind people switching to Mac. One of them is the seamless integration between all the Apple devices and services.Another main reason could be the latest-generation MacBooks and its battery life. Compared to the competition, MacBooks offer much better battery life.And, then thereâs the reliability. Now, Apple Mac devices not only are a solid piece of hardware but also come with software that offers regular updates for several years and offers a reliable and consistent user experience with the least amount of nuisance."

While both claim to offer top-notch features, faster web browsing speeds and enhanced security, there are certain things that both are not so good at. Both the companies keep updating their web browsers with new features and advancements to offer better user experience.Every operating system has its own default web browser. Like Microsoft has its Edgeweb browserfor Windows, Appleâs macOS comes with Safari web browser pre-installed. While both claim to offer top-notch features, faster web browsing speeds and enhanced security, there are certain things that both are not so good at. Both the companyâs keep updating their web browsers with new features and advancements to offer better user experience.But, ever since Microsoft ported itsEdgeweb browser toChromium, it has started getting new features and advancements regularly.The browser now also comes really close to GoogleChrome, in terms of performance and features and more.To get a clear perspective, we have pitted both the browsers against each other in several categories and hereâs how they compare.Edge vs Safari: CompatibilityWhen Microsoft announced Edge, it ensured the web browser is available across the platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, ChromeOS, Linux, etc. On the other hand, Safari is limited to the Apple ecosystem and available only for Apple devices.So, if you are a part of the Apple ecosystem, meaning you own a MacBook, an iPhone, iPad, etc, then Safari will be there and you can access all the data across devices, including history, bookmarks, passwords and more.But Edge being widely available provides the freedom to use any device running any operating system and still be able to access all that data and information.Edge vs Safari: User interface and ease of useEdge and Safari both are developed by software giants and thereâs no doubt that both offer good user interfaces, which are equally easy-to-use. Also, both being a default web browser, the integration into the operating system is also good on their respective operating systems.However, if you are planning to use Edge on macOS, you might find it a little less integrated than Safari.Also, both offer customisation options in their own way. Appleâs Safariâs new tab management feature is better than before and it also allows users to customise and set any image as background image.Edge, on the other hand, offers a slightly more customisable interface by allowing users to theme it up as per their taste.At the end of the day, both are equally good and the customisation options boils down to personal preference.Edge vs Safari: Management and other featuresApart from being good looking and easy to use, a web browser is supposed to be good at managing stuff for users. In this aspect, both Edge and Safai offer good options to users. For example, both offer extensive password management, auto-fill, bookmarks and ability to pin tabs and create tab groups.However, there are a few things that Edge does better. For instance, Edge comes with a feature called Collection that allows users to segregate the research data or shopping data for different occasions in separate collections. It can also be shared with other Edge users which further make it easier for users to work and collaborate in groups.Apart from that, the Edge browser also offers vertical tab features to offer a better workflow.Edge vs Safari: Privacy and securityBoth Edge and Safari offer safe browsing and offer a slew of safety and security features. Safari comes with options like Intelligent Tracking Prevention, Privacy Reports, a pretty good password manager that tells users whether any password has been compromised or leaked.Edge also offers these features, including the Tracking Prevention and comes with built-in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen feature. Apart from that, it also offers different levels of security options.Edge vs Safari: PerformanceAs per HTML5test, the Edge beats Safari and Chrome both. However, that does not mean Safari is a slow web browser. Both have their strengths and weaknesses in this aspect. While Safari being more optimised for macOS, it will offer slightly better performance and efficiency.Apple also claims that Safari offers more battery compared to other web browsers and also consumes less resources.As a counter, Edge offers sleeping tabs, which automatically puts tabs to sleep after a set interval. This also releases the unnecessary resources being consumed by them and improves the efficiency of the browser."

However, the IDE will continue to receive updates for bug fixes and security issues until next year. Microsoft is redirecting its resources to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code for cross-platform development. Alternatives suggested include using Visual Studio Code with the new C# Dev Kit, running the Visual Studio IDE on a Windows virtual machine, or using Visual Studio IDE in the Cloud.Microsofthas announced that it will discontinueVisual Studio for Mac IDE. Announcing the retirement plan, the company confirmed that the latest version of the IDE (Integrated development environment) will continue to be supported for another 12 months and will officially retire on August 31, 2024.The discontinuation will include âNo new framework, runtime, or language support will be added toVisual Studiofor Mac.âVisual Studio for Mac IDE to continue receiving updatesIn the official announcement post, Microsoft has confirmed that the IDE will continue to receive servicing updates for critical bug fixes, security issues, and updated platforms from Apple till August 31 next year.It is important to note that the company will continue to support alternatives like recently announced C#Dev Kitfor VS Code and other extensions. This will enable developers to take advantage of ongoing investments in .NET development on Mac.How users will be affectedâWith todayâs announcement, weâre redirecting our resources and focus to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code, optimizing them for cross-platform development, \" the company said in the official announcement. âWe will also continue to provide runtime and workload updates so you can continue building and shipping applications built on .NET 6, .NET 7, and the Mono frameworks. While not officially supported, weâve also enabled rudimentary support for .NET 8 inVisual Studio for Macfor building and debugging applicationsâ, Microsoft added.Alternatives availableMicrosoft has also suggested some alternatives to developers. Firstly, Visual Studio Code with the new C# Dev Kit and associated extensions offers a versatile choice, enhancing the coding experience for .NET and C# developers on macOS. For comprehensive IDE needs, running theVisual Studio IDEon a Windows virtual machine (VM) hosted on a Mac is a viable solution, covering legacy projects like Xamarin and F# while facilitating remote iOS development. Additionally, Visual Studio IDE in the Cloud provides cloud-hosted VMs through Microsoft Dev Box, granting access to the full power of Visual Studio for .NET/C# development on a Mac, minus the local VM overhead."

        "Content": "Representative Image (Source: Freepik.com)In the world of software development,.NEThas emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the creation and deployment of a wide range of applications, from web and desktop applications to mobile apps and cloud services. Whether you're a developer or someone interested in technology, this blog post will provide you with a detailed understanding of what .NET is, its key components, and its significance in thesoftware developmentlandscape.What is .NET?.NET, pronounced as \"dot net,\" is a free and open-source developer platform developed byMicrosoft. It provides tools, libraries, and runtime environments for building various types of applications. .NET encompasses both the framework and the runtime, collectively enabling developers to create applications that run on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's essential to note that .NET is distinct from .NET Core and .NET Framework, though they share a common lineage.Key Components of .NETCommon Language Runtime (CLR):The CLR is a critical component of the .NET framework. It provides an execution environment for .NET applications, managing memory, handling exceptions, and ensuring type safety. The CLR also includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which converts intermediate language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime.Base Class Library (BCL):The BCL is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide fundamental functionalities such as data manipulation, file I/O, networking, and more. Developers can leverage these components to avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on solving specific problems.Languages:.NET supports multiple programming languages, including C#, VB.NET (Visual Basic .NET), F#, and more. These languages share the common .NET runtime and can interact seamlessly within the same application, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their project requirements and their familiarity..NET Standard:The .NET Standard is a specification that defines a common set of APIs across different .NET implementations. This promotes code reusability by ensuring that libraries targeting the .NET Standard can be used across various platforms, including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin.ASP.NET:ASP.NET is a web framework within the .NET ecosystem, enabling developers to build dynamic, scalable, and secure web applications. It provides features like model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, web API development, and support for creating modern single-page applications (SPAs).Entity Framework:Entity Framework simplifies database interaction by providing an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. It allows developers to work with databases using object-oriented paradigms, reducing the need for writing complex SQL queries.Evolution of .NET: .NET Framework vs. .NET Core vs. .NET 5 and Beyond.NET Framework:Introduced in 2002, .NET Framework was the original implementation of the .NET platform. It primarily targeted Windows applications and included a rich set of libraries and tools. However, it lacked cross-platform compatibility..NET Core:.NET Core, introduced in 2016, was designed with a focus on cross-platform development. It was lightweight, modular, and optimized for modern application scenarios. It gained popularity due to its ability to build applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux..NET 5 and Beyond:Microsoft's approach shifted with the release of .NET 5 in 2020. This marked the unification of .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform. Subsequent versions, such as .NET 6 and beyond, continue this unified approach, providing improved performance, enhanced features, and broader platform support.Significance and Benefits of .NETCross-Platform Development:With .NET's evolution, developers can build applications that run seamlessly on different operating systems, reducing development effort and increasing user reach.Language Choice:Developers can choose from various programming languages to create applications, fostering flexibility and catering to their preferred coding style.Productivity:.NET's extensive libraries and tools streamline development processes, enabling developers to focus on solving business challenges rather than dealing with low-level complexities.Security:.NET incorporates security measures, such as code access security and managed code execution, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing application safety.Ecosystem and Community:The .NET ecosystem boasts a vibrant community and a wealth of resources, including documentation, forums, and third-party libraries, contributing to knowledge sharing and collaboration.ConclusionIn the ever-evolving landscape of software development, .NET stands as a versatile and powerful framework that empowers developers to build applications across a wide range of platforms and devices. With its rich history, robust components, and commitment to innovation, .NET continues to shape the way we create modern software solutions. Whether you're an aspiring developer or a technology enthusiast, understanding .NET opens doors to a world of possibilities in the realm of software development.(The content is generated with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence)"

        "Content": "Reliance Jio has launched its own video-calling platform calledJioMeetin India to take on Zoom and other video-conferencing platforms. JioMeet seems to be targeted at enterprises more than just regular users as it asks for company domain and work email addresses. However, any user can make a JioMeet ID using his/her email account or can even use their phone number to register and start a meeting.Here are the key features of JioMeet and its comparison with Zoom.Zoom basic free planvs JioMeetJioMeet allows up to 100 members to be on the same video meeting altogether similar to Zoomâs basic free plan. But thereâs a difference in time limit and a clear advantage of using JioMeet at least initially.Currently, JioMeet allows 100 members to be on agroup video callfor 24 hours with no restrictions. On the other hand, Zoom allows free unlimited 1-to-1 meetings. But for group meetings of 3 people or more up to 100, only 40 minutes are available for free. If you wish to continue beyond 40 minutes, you will have to disconnect and start another meeting. This is where JioMeet comes handy initially, you can continue the meeting with 100 members for up to 24 hours.Zoom paid plans vs JioMeetFor free and limited usage, JioMeet offers a clear advantage. But when it comes to hosting larger meetings with more features and flexibility, paid Zoom Pro plans make more sense. There are three paid plans of Zoom for small teams, SMEs and large enterprises. The plans start at $14.99 per month per host for up to 9 hosts. But if you need more hosts then you will have to opt for costlier plans. For larger enterprises, Zoom allows up to 1000 participants on a single video call. Zoom also offers custom plans for hosting webinars and Zoom rooms.On the other hand, JioMeet hasnât announced any paid plans yet and it is still unclear as to how many users can JioMeet accommodate for larger enterprises. As for webinars or classroom lectures, there is little clarification from JioMeet as of now.JioMeet vs ZoomexperienceJioMeet offers a very similar user experience when compared to Zoom. JioMeet is available across all platforms including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and web via respective app stores. Users can also download it from Jio Meetâs official website.You can schedule a meeting in advance, password protect meetings and even create a waiting room. Screen Sharing and recording options are also there on both. In fact, all basic features of Zoom are present in JioMeet.JioMeet also claims to support interoperability and can be used on old video conferencing devices as well. The video quality is restricted to 720p in JioMeet and there is the option to change the input camera as well. This means you can use third-party camera apps or a separate video camera altogether for meetings. Zoom also has these features.EncryptionZoom will be offering End-to-End (E2E) encryption to both free and paid users. Without E2E encryption, the security provided by video-calling apps is similar to browsing a website over HTTPS.Reliance Jio claims that meetings in JioMeet are encrypted and password protected. However, the company hasnât revealed any details about End-to-End (E2E) encryption."

        "Content": "iAsk mostiPhoneusers and they would say that the one thing they would take fromAndroidis the customisation. The freedom to tinker with the home screen, apps, icons, add themes and so on.Yet, their appeals â if there were any â fell on deaf ears for years to the people sitting in that fancy spaceship campus in Cupertino. The power of the iPhone and the cult ofAppleperhaps reined them in from a full-blown revolt.Apple, however, has answered their prayers, gift-wrapped the customisation in a nice box with a card that reads: \"Welcome to iOS 18â.Home screen that feels at homeYou might think I'm joking when I say thatiOS 18's superpower is to paint icons any colour and put them all over your screen. But, I am not. WithApple Intelligenceunavailable to most iPhone users, this seemingly simple customisation is the main plot point of iOS 18.I know an Android person reading this right now would perhaps be doing an eye roll. Don't. Yes, we're a little late to the party, but let us have some fun, too. However, that'll be a little out of character for an iPhone user like me, who's been rather used to being locked away in grids and no colour on their home screen. But iOS 18 let me break those shackles, have the home screen of my dreams and paint it red.It's as easy as it could get. No jailbreaking or creating a Siri Shortcut, which is quite a task, to be frank. Just press and hold the home screen, tap the Edit button in the top left corner, and play around with the bunch of options there. You can choose the icon size, colours â have them light, dark, or tinted. And again, you can put the icons wherever you want, literally anywhere.One of my favourite customisation options has been that I can just enlarge the icon size, which hides away their names and makes the home screen feel a little eased out (you know, what I mean). But that leaves some extra space at the bottom of the home screen right above the app tray, which could have accommodated one more row of apps, and while that irked me in the beginning, I have settled down with it.Then comes the option to colour up the icons â though you might not always like the colour that your iPhone has chosen for you, you can always play around with the colour picker and choose for yourself, or simply have them dark. Or you can leave it automatic, so when the sun sets, your icons also turn dark with the wallpaper. Though, third-party apps had a hard time matching up to the theme, but one can hope for things to get better.So, what did I do with all this power bestowed upon me? I painted several home screens, some ugliest to their core and some so beautiful I couldn't stop awing at my skills. It may just be the home screen dream come true for many, isn't it?The only thing now I need is the power to remove all the apps from my home screen at once. I hope you're listening, Tim.More control over âControlsâThe changes don't end here. Remember how all of a sudden we all were swiping down rather than swiping up for the Control Centre? Well, that remains the same, just that you'll have to swipe a little extra. However, there is a big change â theControl Centreis paginated, customisable, and a little colourful.Just like on the home screen, you can move around the controls and change their size. They no longer need to be round and can also be changed to rectangles or squares, all having rounded edges. You can stretch the network panel and the music widget to occupy the whole page; they also have their separate pages by default.That's just the first page, called Favourites. There is a whole gallery for controls, much like the widgets, and that'll also include controls from third-party apps, so you can pick all you want and have a second, a third, and as many pages as you want.Speaking of widgets, there are a few new first-party widgets for the home screen, like Vitals, Journal and Training Load. And if any of the apps have a widget available, you can resize the icon of that app into a widget or vice versa.There's one more Android power that's been granted to iOS: the ability to customise the quick buttons on the lock screen. Yes, the era of the long-lived flashlight and camera combo on the lock screen comes to an end. Exactly like Control Centre, now you can choose different quick controls, ranging from dark mode to calculator, or even shortcuts. Soon, there should be third-party options available too.Lock or hide the apps wayWhile it would have been nice to have the option to customise the App Library, it seems to be saved for future versions. Because you can't have everything you want, right? But you can have things that really matter to you. At some point, while using your iPhone, you might have wondered about having the option to lock apps or even hide them. Well, in iOS 18, that's possible.So when you long press an app icon, you'll be presented with two options â Require Face ID or Hide and Require Face ID. The first one essentially means \"lock\" and the other one is the \"hide\" option.Now, when you lock an app, opening it will need Face ID, and it'll continue to show up on the home screen. But if you want to make an app vanish from your home screen, choose the hide option.Hiding an app will make it disappear from the home screen, and it'll settle down in a hidden folder in the App Library. You can find this folder at the bottom of the library, and it won't preview the app icons until you unhide the apps using Face ID.A safe house for all your passwordsNow that we are on the topic of privacy and safety, let's also touch on the Passwords app. Yes, iOS (iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and Windows, too) now has a first-party password manager of its own. All the accounts, Wi-Fi passwords, and Passkeys now sit inside the Passwords app, outside of the Settings. The app will also send you alerts if any of your accounts get compromised.All this syncs across devices, so if you are saving a password on your iPhone, that'll also work on your iPad, Mac, or even Windows PC for that matter. You can also AirDrop the passwords to others.Well, this isn't entirely new; the Keychain has been serving the same purpose for a while. But you might or might not have been aware of this. So, with a separate app that sits right in your App Library, it becomes easier to manage the passwords.One privacy change that I really appreciate is the option to decide which contacts I want to share with an app. Rather than giving an app access to all contacts, you can now choose just the contacts you know you'll need in the app. This way, the app won't have access to all your contacts.Photos app knows youAmong all the changes, the Photos app has been radically redesigned. Ditching the tabs, the app now has a unified page, combining Library, For You, and Albums â all on one screen. So, there's no need to switch tabs anymore; all you need to do is scroll.Up top is the Library, showing all the pictures you have taken, screenshots, or the ones you have saved. If you simply scroll up, you'll get the good old Library view, with filters â Years, Months, All â plus sorting options, and a close button that returns to the default view.Swiping right will show you the new Carousel, which will have featured photos, memories, favourites, and more. If you want, you can customise the upper half â add more Collections, replace the current ones, or remove them as well.But there's more going on in the bottom half. You'll see Recent Days, People, Memories, and more. These have always been tucked away in the For You page, so again this is something you might or might not have come across daily or ever. But now you have these up front, so you can rediscover the oldest of snaps and have curated albums for the special days, your friends and family.Scroll down further, and you'll find more â like all the albums, different media types, deleted photos, and hidden ones as well.Redesigns don't come easy, especially for an app that you use almost daily. There's for sure a bit of a learning curve. It took me a couple of days to get used to this layout, and for the first few days, I didn't like it much and wanted the old layout back. But now that I have used it for over a month, I've come to appreciate how the new app just serves its purpose of discovering photos.The blue bubble, green bubble saga comes to an end (sort of)Next up isMessages. After adding a couple of handy new features like Stickers and Check-In, among others, in recent years, Apple is adding a few more this year as well. First on the list isRCS, the Rich Communication Services, the same messaging standard that's been used on Android phones. Itâs different that hardly any of us in India donât even care about RCS.But for those who are sensitive about the blue and green bubbles, how do things change now? Is this the end of the green bubble vs. blue bubble war? Well, both yes and no.While you can now send pictures and videos without making them look like they're from the 2000s, and even have read receipts and be in group chats together, the blue and green bubble divide still remains. Texts from your iPhone friends will still be blue and those coming from Android continue to appear green in Messages, though the two now have a more level playing field.Though, I couldn't use the RCS here in India as of now.A feature to come that most of us would care about more is Send Later, which is a godsend for forgetful people and early sleepers like me. I can simply schedule a message, be it a birthday wish or something else, for up to a year in advance.You can now use any emoji to react to a message, or even use a sticker for that. And if you like to be a little more expressive with your texts, you can use the new text formatting options or animate them with WordArt-style effects. Though, the old message effects are gone (not going to lie, they were a little more fun).T9 dialer on iPhone, finallyThe Phone app has also received some love, bringing in a T9 dialer, so you can find contacts just by typing their name on the keypad. You can also search for previous calls, transcribed voicemails, and contacts right in the Recents tab. A little discovery I made is that you can type in a month in the search bar, and it'll show you all the calls you made in that month.Sorted emailsSince we're talking about communication, let me quickly go through what's new with the Mail app. There isn't much new right now, but later this year the Mail app will gain some smarts that'll help categorise emails into different groups â Primary, Transactions, Promotions, and Updates.The Primary tab will essentially have emails from your friends and family, while other emails will be categorised in other tabs. A new digest view will also show snippets of receipts, marketing emails and newsletters grouped together by sender.Notes learn mathsI am always on theNotes app, noting down one thing or another, and I guess I'm going to use it even more just because I can now have collapsible subheads and highlight text, so I'll have neater-looking notes. And if that didn't impress me enough, I can now transcribe conversations right into the app. Then, there's the ability to do maths directly in the app.Whether it's adding up the budget for a vacation or splitting the grocery bill, all you need to do is type or write down the maths, and you'll have the answer. The app even remembers these calculations in case you are sitting down for a long problem. And the same can be done in the Messages.And maths gets a little funOh, about maths, the Calculator app is being updated, too. The app can now do scientific calculations and unit conversions. It also shows all the previous calculations for the last 30 days, and if you want, you can delete a specific calculation or delete them all. That's not it, the calculator can now do the expressions directly.Apple calls it Maths Notes. It works just like you'd think. The toggle opens up a new note where you can do the maths. It functions exactly like the maths feature in the Notes app. You can type down the expressions or handwrite them, on and on.The tidbitsOne helpful addition that isnât appreciated enough is the coupling of Reminders and the Calendar app. Alongside the regular calendar events, the Calendar app now also show the reminders. Not just view but you can also create new reminders, edit or complete them right in the Calendar.Safari also got a couple of new features. The Reader is being redesigned; it now has a table of contents and shows a summary, so you get the gist of the article before you start reading it. Next is Highlights, which will highlight relevant information on a webpage. Though, I wasn't able to use any of these features in the beta until now.Coming directly from macOS, Game Mode is now available on iOS. It works as the name implies, ensuring that games play out perfectly. Additionally, there's reduced latency with AirPods and game controllers.If you've been journaling on your iPhone, iOS 18 brings some handy upgrades. You can now log your mood directly in the Journal app, with an option to count writing time as mindful minutes in Health. A new insights view shows your streaks and stats, making it easier to track goals. Improved sorting and search help you find old entries quickly. Plus, new widgets for your Home or Lock Screen offer writing prompts and streak displays.Apple's not forgetting about accessibility in iOS 18, and one helpful feature out of the lot is Eye Tracking, whichâll let one control their iPhone with just your peepers - no hands required. Then there's Music Haptics, which syncs the Taptic Engine with the rhythm of songs, so those who can't hear the beat, can feel it. Vocal Shortcuts is here for folks with severe atypical speech.Wait, whereâs the AIUhh, there is AI underlying iOS, but no Apple Intelligence for now. So, all the nice party tricks, like Writing Tools, Image Playground, and the new Siri, are late to the party. You should get them later this year, probably in September, though they'll still be in beta and only available to those in the US. And that's not the saddest part. The saddest part is that only those with iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (and the newer ones coming this year) will only be able to get on the AI train.Little heads up, the Apple Intelligence is now out for developers to test with iOS 18.1 developer beta. But, since it won't be available for many of you all, I am going to talk about it separately.Wrap upIt's clear that Apple has made significant strides in customisation, personalisation and user control. From painting your home screen any colour to the revamped Control Centre and lock screen customisation, iOS 18 brings a level of personalisation that iPhone users have long desired.The redesigned Photos app, while initially jarring, proves to be a more intuitive way to rediscover memories. Updates to core apps like Messages, Notes, and Calculator add useful features that streamline daily tasks. Then, there are more additions, like Game Mode, Eye Tracking, among others, and these add up to uplift the whole iPhone experience.However, it's important to note that this beta version is just a glimpse of what's to come, with some highly anticipated AI, or as Apple calls it, Apple Intelligence, which promises a \"more capable and helpful\" Siri, not yet available and won't ever be available for most people. Despite this, iOS 18 represents a significant step forward for the iPhone, blending some of the flexibility traditionally associated with Android while maintaining the polished user experience Apple is known for and most people would ever care for. So, wait till September, and yâall are in for a treat."
